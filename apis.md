description: Ducksboard is a real-time dashboard for tracking internal metrics and
  web services.A single place where you can gather data from all SaaS apps you use
  (GoogleAnalytics, Mailchimp, Twitter, Zendesk&#8230;), as well as any internal metric
  you might consider. You can access your metrics in real time from your browser,
  but you will also be able to generate Excel and PDF files to share with your team
  or export widgets to your intranet.As well as on functionality, we are focused on
  providing an amazing UX. Forget the typical cluttered dashboard full of useless
  green/yellow/red gauges. We are building something so useful and beautiful that
  you will want to put it on a large screen and hang it on your office&#8217;s wall.
